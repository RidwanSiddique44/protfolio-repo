                <h3 class="orange-color">2022-present| Pro level developer</h3>
                <p>s a web developer with two years of experience, I have honed my skills in front-end and back-end
                    development, contributing to a variety of projects. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has
                    enabled me to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces, while my experience with frameworks
                    like React and Angular has allowed me to build dynamic web applications.

                    On the back end, I have worked extensively with Node.js and Express, implementing RESTful APIs and
                    managing databases using MongoDB and SQL. I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to design
                    and develop features that enhance user experience and improve performance.

                    In addition to technical skills, I have embraced agile methodologies, participating in sprints and
                    contributing to project planning and execution. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code
                    and have a keen eye for detail, ensuring high-quality deliverables.

                    Through my experience, I have developed strong problem-solving skills and an ability to adapt to new
                    technologies quickly. I am passionate about continuous learning and staying updated with industry
                    trends, which drives my dedication to delivering innovative web solutions. </p>

                <h2>Research enthusiast</h2>
                <h3 class="orange-color">2020-2024| Marine Science student</h3>
                <p>As a Marine Science student at the University of Chittagong, I have spent the past two years
                    immersing myself in the study of marine ecosystems and coastal management. My coursework has covered
                    essential topics such as marine biology, oceanography, and environmental science, providing me with
                    a strong foundational knowledge of marine systems and their dynamics.

                    During this time, I have engaged in hands-on research, participating in field studies along the
                    coastline of the Bay of Bengal. My research focused on the impact of climate change on local marine
                    biodiversity, where I collected and analyzed data on species distribution and habitat health.
                    Collaborating with faculty and fellow students, I contributed to a project aimed at assessing the
                    ecological effects of pollution in coastal waters, which culminated in a presentation at a regional
                    conference.

                    Additionally, I have developed essential laboratory skills, including water quality analysis and
                    biological sampling techniques. My experiences have not only enhanced my research capabilities but
                    also reinforced my commitment to marine conservation and sustainable practices. I am eager to apply
                    my knowledge in future research and initiatives aimed at protecting our vital marine resources.</p>
